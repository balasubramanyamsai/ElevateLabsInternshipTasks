## Task 1: Create a Simple Responsive Landing Page Using HTML & CSS.


🛠️ What we built:
We created a clean and responsive website that adjusts smoothly to different screen sizes—whether someone’s using a laptop, tablet, or phone.

It includes:

A simple navigation bar where the links disappear on smaller screens to avoid clutter and keep things tidy.

A “Why Choose Us” section that highlights our key strengths like Expertise, Innovation, and Customer Satisfaction—all laid out clearly.

A contact form where people can enter their name, email, and upload their resume. We made sure all fields are required, so we don’t miss important info.

The site looks great and works well across devices, thanks to the responsive design we added using CSS.

🌟 In simple words:
It’s like giving a business a smart digital front door—one that welcomes visitors, tells them why the business is awesome, and lets them reach out easily.
